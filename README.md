# Eyes Exercise
This project shows a pair of animated eyes that follow the cursor around the screen. This is a simple example of using document.onmousemove to make websites more interactive by engaging the user with effects or info as they browse the site.
## How to Run
No interaction by the user is needed. The eyes will simply follow the cursor around.
## Roadmap
I plan on adding images around the eyes that will change when the cursor is over them. This can be used for creative & artistic applications, i.e. a "conspiracy" themed site for a movie or book could remodel it as the Illuminati eye, have images of papers connected with string that reveal "secret info" only when the cursor hovers over them.
